# Polyomino-Generation

A polyomino is a 2D geometry comprised of squares joined edge-to-edge. These geometries are often subcategorized to their enumeration, which specifies the number of squares by which it is comprised. There are a few methods for generating these figures for categorization (like Jensen's algorithm or a more iterative approach) however there is no fixed method to discover these shapes. This repo aims to, if not provide that method, amalgamate helpful tools and visualizations that may be helpful in that method's creation. 

### Features, Plans, and Goals

* Graphic visualization for polyomino generation
* Comprehensive set of data for each enumeration
